      <p>Our Troop was first chartered in 1955 as Troop 12, with Scoutmaster Gordon Gallagher and sponsored by St Nicholas Catholic Church.  In 1975, District #2 was added to the troop number to become Troop 212.  In 1978, the troop moved from St Nicholas and changed sponsors to Chapel Hill Presbyterian Church.</p>
      <p>Scoutmasters since 1955 have been: Gordon Gallagher, Richard Meyer, George Fry, Sr., Earl Kraft, John Dower, Leslie Jones, Ron Chilton (twice), Ked Gadd, Tom Nemec, Spruce Cox, Scott Eason, Cliff Uehlin, James Spitzer, David Aston, Tim Saxon, and David Hurn.</p>
      <p>Troop 212 has received a commendation from the Washington State Parks Department for its many hours of volunteer service and a special commendation from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers for over $13,000 worth of labor developing and maintaining hiking trails, campsites and fire brakes at the Dvorshak Reservoir in Idaho.</p>
      <p>Troop 212 maintains a reputation as one of the most active troops in the Pacific Harbors Council including at least one overnight campout every month and a long-term outing and week-long camp every summer.</p>
      <p>The troop is listed in the Congressional Record for its Bi-Centennial project.</p>
      <p>We made and erected flagpoles in front of the old Gig Harbor City Hall, Chapel Hill Presbyterian Church, and the Fox Island Community Center.</p>
      <p>Scouts from our troop have attended Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico, National Jamborees at Moraine State Park in Pennsylvania, Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia and Farragut, Idaho.</p>
      <p>The troop has attended summer camp at Camp Hohobas on the Hood Canal, Camp Fife in the Cascades, Camp Thunderbird in Tumwater, and Camp Meriwether on the Oregon Coast.  The troop conducts <b>its own summer camp</b> on Lake Roosevelt every 3 years.</p>
      <p>The troop’s long-term outings (5-9 days) have been hikes in the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, along the Washington coast, and on the West Coast Trail of Vancouver Island; bike trips on the Oregon Coast and San Juan Islands; canoe trips on Ross Lake, Dworshak Reservoir, and the Willamette River; and whitewater canoe trips on several Washington state rivers.</p>

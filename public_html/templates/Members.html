<p>Welcome to Troop 212's Online Directory and Registration site! A few words on how to best use this site. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Scoutmaster or one of the Assistant Scoutmasters</p>
<p>Registration to this website is closed and controlled. All requests for login must be approved and if the requester is not recognized, they will not be granted access until we verify their identity.</p>
<p>Personal information such as email address and phone numbers are collected to provide online directory services for other members of the Troop, but also to support online event registration. It is important that the Troop leadership have good emergency contact info for all Scouts participating in Troop 212 Events. Rosters will be printed from the online registration, including phone numbers provided for parents of participating Scouts. For this reason we ask that Parents keep this information accurate and up to date.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
